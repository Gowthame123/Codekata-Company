Given a number N followed by N numbers. Out of these N numbers some of them are repeated. Write a program to find the number which is repeated and print the repeated numbers in sorted order. If no numbers are repeated print "unique".
Input Size : 1 <= N <= 100000
Sample Testcase :
INPUT
7
1 2 3 2 3 4 3
OUTPUT
2 3

CODE:

n = int(input())
arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
final = set()
repeated = set()
for num in arr:
    if num in final:
        repeated.add(num)
    else:
        final.add(num)
if not repeated:
    print('unique')
else:
    print(' '.join(map(str, repeated)))
